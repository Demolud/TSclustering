# Clustering Macroeconomic Time Series

This web application is an extension to the paper ["Clustering Macroeconomic Time Series"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04004).

One can upload a .csv file and the application will visualise data in the form of dendrogram based on methodology elaborated in the paper.

Application is running on my server at http://iwoaugustynski.ue.wroc.pl/apps/TSclustering/

You can check how it works using a.csv file from repository.
